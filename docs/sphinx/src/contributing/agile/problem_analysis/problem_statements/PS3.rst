=====================
PS3: Prioritize tasks
=====================

About
-----

*Mostly I tend to work on the tasks that give me great pleasure and continuously postpone working on tasks that don't give as much joy, chores like paying taxes, etc.- I believe because I lack the context on why to execute those tasks. But it would be great to know which tasks need to be completed when, or which ones are more important - by some objective measurement - so I could better navigate the backlog or the tasks I feel like working on.*
