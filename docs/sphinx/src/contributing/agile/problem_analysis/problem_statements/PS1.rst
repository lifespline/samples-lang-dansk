========================
PS1: Tracking TODO tasks
========================

About
-----

*Sometimes I forget to track tasks and I'm only reminded wither when it's too late, or when there are already consequences to my negligence, say fines with interest. The knowledge that I may be forgetting something is always with me and it generates permanently an unconfortable level of anxiety, or it hinders a feeling of safety from settling in.*
